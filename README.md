Road infrastructure is important for industries and social activities. Improving the quality of roads is critically needed to support regional infrastructure development, one of which is road maintenance which requires considerable time and effort. The idea of this project is to reduce the time and effort required to carry out the checks on road maintenance by applying machine learning to recognize road damage and then reporting it so that it can be seen how accurate the accuracy of the project is.
